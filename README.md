## DeepBayesOOD

MVA Project – Evaluating the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection capabilities of DeepBayes on CIFAR-10.

### Description

This project investigates how well deep Bayesian classifiers can identify out-of-distribution samples. We analyze predictive uncertainty, test several OOD scoring methods, and compare their performance across different OOD datasets.
